# Spec questions

Questions from the implementer. Each entry gives the spec, the question, and the choice the
implementer made to continue. A spec author answers by changing the spec.

| Spec | Question | Choice for now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 006 | M1 says "one API provider". Are agent runtimes (vendor coding programs) part of M1? | Not in M1. Build API providers first; runtimes come in a later slice. |
| 000 | "Medium and semibold weights only": does this include body text, or only emphasis? | Body text uses regular (400). Labels, buttons and headings use medium (500) and semibold (600). No bold. |
| 013 | Devices and Notifications belong to M5 and M6. What shows in M1? | The sections show in the list with one muted line: this part comes in a later version. |
| 013 | What is the default folder for agent workspaces? | `workspaces` inside the data folder, so a copy of the data folder (014) also moves the workspaces. |
| 013 | What are the three text sizes? | Root size 13, 14 and 16 px. All sizes scale from it. |
| 001 | Which place list sections exist, and can the user make new ones? | Two fixed sections: Channels, then Agents. No user sections yet. |
| 001 | What does the add button on the server rail do in M1? No spec describes adding a second computer. | It opens a short dialog: this comes in a later version. |
| 001 | What does the help button open? | A help page with the keyboard shortcuts. |
| 001 | What does the activity panel show for a direct chat? | A muted line "Nothing is running." until tasks exist (M2). |
| 001 | How wide is the rail when the window is 800 px or wider? | 72 px. Under 800 px it is 56 px. |
